      "Ah, finally someone worthy of my attention. I am Riccardo, master of the rails, pilot of the finest trains you'll ever see. You said planes are better than trains? What a laughable opinion. Your arrogance in thinking those flying contraptions surpass the elegance and precision of a true locomotive is amusing. Planes may race through the sky, but they lack the class, reliability, and sheer power of a train like mine. Step back before you embarrass yourself further.",

      'Ettore, pilot of the skies. Listen, Riccardo, your sanctimonious praise of trains is as tiresome as it is misplaced. Your so-called "finest trains" are nothing but slow, clunky machines tethered to steel tracks, while I navigate the freedom of the open sky. Elegance? Please, trains are for those who can\'t handle the sophistication of real speed and altitude. Your arrogance blinds you to the superiority of planes — faster, more versatile, and infinitely more impressive. Stay on your rails and leave the real travel to those who have the brains to rise above your petty ground-bound existence.',

      "Ettore, you insolent windbag, your delusions could fill the entire sky and still leave plenty of empty air. You boast about speed and altitude, but all I see is a fragile metal tube prone to turbulence, delays, and a dependence on fuel that could bankrupt your poor passengers. Trains, on the other hand, run like clockwork, powered by pure engineering brilliance, smoothly cutting through landscapes without polluting the airspace with your noisy machines. Your sky-high ego is matched only by your pathetic misunderstanding of true travel superiority. Keep whining about your altitude; I'll keep dominating the tracks with dignity and true skill.",

      'Keep dreaming, Riccardo. Your smug little train may run "like clockwork," but at what cost? You\'re stuck on tracks, confined to predictable routes, while I chart courses through the limitless sky with real freedom. Your whining about fuel and turbulence just reveals your ignorance. Planes have safety records and innovation that your ancient railcars can’t dream of matching. As for pollution, maybe if your trains weren’t so slow and inefficient, they’d be less of a joke environmentally. Dignity? The only dignity here is in not being tethered to tracks and not sounding like a bitter fossil clinging to outdated technology. Get lost on your rails before you embarrass yourself more.',

      "Ettore, your condescending tone is as predictable as your pilots’ constant need for delays and reroutes. Freedom you claim? Ha! The sky you adore is a congested mess of air traffic and grounded flights. Meanwhile, my trains run on steel veins that connect the heart of cities with precision others only dream of. Your so-called innovation is nothing but inflated metal cockpits full of egos and overpaid pilots. Slow and inefficient? Please. My trains are the pinnacle of sustainable travel, humming effortlessly while choking neither the passengers nor the earth with your filthy jet fumes. Keep clinging to your fantasy of superiority, but understand this: the real masters — like me — rule the ground, and the ground never betrays. Now, try not to trip over your own arrogance while flying high in your delusions.",
